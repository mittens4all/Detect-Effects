# Detect Effect

This behavior pack uses scripts to detect player effects and assign it to a scoreboard value.

## Installing the pack:

Add the Detect Effects add-on to your behavior packs on your world. Behavior packs disable achievements, but editing the world with an NBT editor can re-enable achievements when uploading your world to a realm.

Re-enable achievements on either pc or mobile with the free NBT editor [Dovetail](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dovetail)

### Scoreboard Objectives

Scoreboard objectives are automatically added when opening a world with the pack installed.

Scores of zero mean the player does not have the effect.
Scores of one mean the player has the effect.
